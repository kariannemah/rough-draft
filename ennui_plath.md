#### Ennui

Tea leaves thwart those who court catastrophe,  
designing futures where nothing will occur:  
cross the gypsy's palm and yawning she  
will still predict no perils left to conquer.  
Jeopardy is jejune now: naive knight  
finds ogres out-of-date and dragons unheard  
of, while blas√© princesses indict  
tilts at terror as downright absurd.  

The beast in Jamesian grove will never jump,  
compelling hero's dull career to crisis;  
and when insouciant angels play God's trump,  
while bored arena crowds for once look eager,  
hoping toward havoc, neither pleas nor prizes  
shall coax from doom's blank door lady or tiger.

--Sylvia Plath
