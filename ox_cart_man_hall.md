#### Ox Cart Man

In October of the year
I count potatoes dug from the brown field,
counting the seed, counting
the cellar's portion out,
and bag the rest on the cart's floor.

Then in my cart I pack wool
sheered from the sheep in April, and cloth
my wife wove from the thread she spun,
singles I split all winter,
leather tanned from the hides

of deer and cattle, linen, flaxseed, apples,
cabbages, honey in combs,
and last year's cider
in the vinegar barrel
hooped by hand at the forge's fire.

I walk by the ox, ten days to Portsmouth Market,
and sell potatoes,
and the bag that carried potatoes,
aprons, birch brooms,
shingles, turnips, goose feathers.

When my cart is empty I sell my cart.
When my cart is gone I sell my ox,
harness and yoke,
and walk home, pockets full of the year's coin
for salt and taxes, for the Christmas orange,

at home by fire's light in November cold
I stitch new harness
for next year's ox in the barn,
I carve his yoke, I cut planks
to build a cart again,
