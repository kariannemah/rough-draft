### Rough Draft

I love reading other people's drafts. The more a draft is marked up, the better. It's a good reminder that we improve our writing--both the piece at hand and our general skill--not by writing more, but by editing over and over again.

[Now that Github allows us to render prose diffs](https://github.com/blog/1784-rendered-prose-diffs), why not visualize the editing process of our favorite poets and writers?

Finding multiple drafts of a single poem is tricky. More and more university archives are digitizing their collections, but selections thereof appear online in dribs and drabs.

Virginia Commonwealth University hosts two typescript drafts of ["Ennui" by Sylvia Plath](http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v5n2/poetry/plath_s/typescript-draft.htm). I've included this poem as a first example. You can see the prose diff here.


Next up is [Donald Hall's Ox Cart Man](http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/exhibits/jane-kenyon-and-donald-hall/ox-cart-man/draft15) with many more drafts!
